            <p>Hello! My name is Raisa Islam, and I am a passionate and enthusiastic final-year Computer Science and Engineering student. I love creating and exploring innovative solutions in the digital world. My interest in web development and programming began during my academic journey, where I immersed myself in various projects and self-initiated endeavors to deepen my understanding of software development.</p><br></br>

<p>Despite not having formal work experience yet, I have completed numerous academic and personal projects that have honed my skills in web development, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. These projects have provided me with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and other modern technologies.</p><br></br>

<p>I am currently seeking internship or job opportunities to gain practical experience and contribute to meaningful projects. I am eager to learn from industry professionals, collaborate with talented teams, and apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. My goal is to build accessible, inclusive, and impactful digital experiences that make a difference.</p>
